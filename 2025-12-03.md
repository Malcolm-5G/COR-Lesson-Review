Review at COR

Today was a pretty light day. This Wednesday was the first Professonial Development day with Mr. Ron Cofield. We discuss lfie core values. He made us choose the three core values that were the most valuable to my current situation. The 3 that were important tom me the most were... Growth, Competence, and integrity. These three are important to me now because they these values will hold me accountable in this cybersecurity journey. I have to grow in being the best cybersecurity student i can be in this program. Competence to gain the knowledge and obtain additonal information to suceed in interviews and other professional oppurtunities. Integrity involves me to be honest and truthful about myself. Not to lie to others and just to respect myself. It's hard to continue to lie to other and stil expect them to trust what you really say or do. After Mr.Cofield presented, Paul Farley presented to the class, His knowlegede about tech is top teir including the accomplishment he has. After lucnch, we dived the class and discuss dress code for professonial developement. They really want us to dress to impress on Wednesdays. Also, its importatant to comfortable with dress in the coorprate enviroment.
