Lessom Review at COR


Our last day of our first week was far from boring. Friday we team up in groups to figure out how to configure this spaceship panel to proceed to the next level. We had to use the development skills that we learned throughout the week,  which including discipline, collaboration, curiosity, teamwork, etc. After lunch we played the game for a second time to see if we had any new techniques to beat our previous record. This time, our teams were able to collaborate with other teams to see how others implement strategize to suceed in the game. I love the excitement about our class. Friday really prove that eveeryone in the class is here to do their best for the next seven months. Before the class ended Frisay,Mr. Bricker wanted the class input on what he can do to excell his training for the future classes.
