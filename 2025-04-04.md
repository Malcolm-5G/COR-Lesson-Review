Today we went in depth with the Physcial Layere or the OSI Model 

Physiacl
 
  Copper/Twisted Pair (Electrical Signal)
    
  STP (Sheilded Twisted Pair)
      - A type of twisted-pair cable that includes additional shielding (usually a foil or braided mesh) around the twisted 
        pairs to protect against EMI.

Characteristics

Better resistance to interference than UTP.

Heavier and less flexible due to shielding.

Requires proper grounding to be effective.

More expensive than UTP.

Common Uses

Industrial environments with high EMI (e.g., factories with heavy machinery).

Areas with high RF interference (e.g., near radio transmitters).

Some data center or enterprise network deployments.
   

    
    UTP (UnSheilded Twisted Pair)

      - A type of copper cable where pairs of wires are twisted together to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI), but 
        there is no additional shielding.

Characteristics

Most common type of Ethernet cable (e.g., Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a).

Lacks a metallic shield, making it lighter and more flexible.

Susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI).

Used in most office and home networks.

Common Uses

Ethernet (LAN) connections (e.g., connecting PCs to switches).

Telephone lines.

Patch cables.
