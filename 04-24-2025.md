ACL (Access Control List)
    --> Control In-Going + Out-Going Traffic 

Once a firewall contains a ACL Table it basically becomes a router 

Stateless
  --> Just Packets 
  --> No History 
  --> Fast
  --> May use LATNECY 

Stateful
  --> Contains/List 
  --> Data-Flow 
  --> More Secure

Firewall Packing
  --> Host-Base Firewall 
      --> Based on one computer 

Network-Based firewall
  --> Protecsts the entire Network

5 thing for Firewall 
1) Port Filtering 
    --> Filters based on Port#
2) MAC Filtering 
    --> Filters to decives based on MAC Address 
3) IP filtering/ Packet Filter 
    --> Filters depends on where the IP Address come from 
4) Content Filtering 
    --> Filters based on information
5) Dynamic Filer/Stateful Filter
    --> Checks/filter packtets from every layer 

PACKETS ARE LIKE A STREAM

UTM(Unified Threat Management)
Next-Gen 

Proxy 
    --> MiddleMAn 
    --> Agent for Client 
    --> bypass the firewall 
    --> * Applincation Firewall "WAF"

  --> Foward Proxy Client           Client -------> Server
      --> bypass restricted Website
        --> Out Bound to Internet
  --> Reverse Proxy                Server <------- Client 
      --> Talk back to the Serveres form the inernet protect serveres 
        --> Load Balancing 
UTM 
  --> All -in- One Device/Secure 

Next-Gen Firewalls 

Circuit-Level Gateway
    --> Session Layer 5
      --> Stateful

Hardware Based 
  --> Physcial

Software Base
  --> Software 
    Ex. McAfee and MS Defedner

Application Firewall 
  --> Stand alone hardware firewall 
    --> UTM = all-in-one 

Router Firewall 
  Firewall built insdie the router firmware

LAN Topology   
    --> Layout of how a network comunnicates 

3 Types of Topology 
    --> Physical 
      --> Logical
        --> Hybrid
8 Topologies 
  (P2P) Point to Point 
  Bus Top/Dasiy chain Top
  Ring Top 
  Star Top 

  Hybrid 
  Star-Ring
  Star-Bus 
    --> Ethernet LAN 

Enterprsie Network Technology 

PAN
  -->Personal Aren Network

LAN
  -->LOcal Aren Network

WLAN
  -->Wireless Local Area Network 

CAN 
  -->Campus Area Network 

MAN
  -->Metropolitan Area Network

SAN
  -->Storage Area Network

WAN (Wide Area Network) 
  -->Largest type of Network
    --> Spans over the World = Internet 
      --> Mest Topology
