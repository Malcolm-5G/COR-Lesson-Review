Computers are logical machines!!!


Ram > Gives Instructions >>>>>> Rom > Output Instructions

BInary 
 
8 Bit = 1 Character
	
8 Bit = 1 byte
1000 bytes = 1 Kilobyte
1000 Kilobytes = 1 Megabyte
1000 Megabytes = 1 Gigabyte
1000 Gigabytes = 1 Terabyte

1= On
0= Off

Analog vs Digital 

Analog 
  -Smooth and Continuous
 -Signals get weaker
 -Can take any volume
 
Analog Amplifier
 -Amplify Noise

Digital 
 -Very large but not infinite 
 -0 & 1 Binary

 Modulate = Change Frequency




Digital Data —> Digital Signal 
Digital Data ←- Digital Signal
               
ASCII & Unicode




ASCII >>>> 7 Bits 
		>> 127 Numbers
			>> Basic symbols and letters
	127 Character/ Instructions

Unicode >>>> 0 - 127
		>>> More characters than ASCII
			>>> same as ASCII up to 0 - 127 character
				>>> can use up to 32 Bits per character
Change = 0
No Change = 1


Frequency Change = 1
No Change = 0


Hexadecimal Number
	>>> number system has 16 symbols
		>>> 1-9, A - F 
Base 10 
	>>> Numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

Addressing >>> Scheme of binary and hex

Network Card >>> Can read Binary & Hex

OSI Model

Application >>> Http(80),Https(443),ftp(20,21),DNS(53),SSH(22),SMTP(25),DHCP(67,68)
Presentation >>>Data Format Translation>>ASCII or Unicode>>Encrypt/Compression
Session >>>Start/Maintain/Stop
Transport >>>TCP/UDP>>”Reliable”>>”Flow Control”>>Sequence

Network Node
	>> Device w/ a network identity 
		>> Can be physical and logical 

Physical Hardware Address
	>> Network Interface Card (NIC)
		>> IS UNIQUE

Logical Address 
	>> Can Change


IP Address 
	>> IPv4	x.x.x.x.
	>>IPv6		


Classful Addressing 
	
	5 Classes 
CL A 	1 - 126
CL B	128 - 191
CL C	192 - 223
CL D 	Multicast
CL E 	Experimental
