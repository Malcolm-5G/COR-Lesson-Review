Broadcast Domain 

    How to connect multiple Broadcast Domain?

-> Traditional Way<--
  --> Add More Routers

--> Create VLAN
  --> Multiple VLANs with in the switch 

--> Layer 3/ Layer 4 Switch
  --> Layer 3 --> PAckets Interpet/Routes 
  --> Layer 4 --> Interpet Layer 4 TCP/UDP

VLAN
  --> Creeping multiople networks on one physical switch 

Subnets vs VLANs
  --> Both do the same thing 

Subnets 
  --> divides the the network on a switch by subnetting 

VLANs
  --> Splits network logically on one swith 
      (Can divide a switch logically into different networks/departments)

Static VLAN vs Dynamic VLAN

Static VLAN 
  --> Port Base VLAN 
      (Can only talk to ports/network its configured too)

Dynamic VLAN 
  --> MAC Based 
    --> VMPS Server 


Default VLAN vs Native VLAN

Inter VLAN routing 
  --> Traditional Physcial Router 
      --> Routes Through 
      ** 802.1q Trunk 
  --> Route on a stick 

  --> Multilayer Switch 
      --> SVI
  Trunk
    --> Logical IP Converter

    Hub(Physical Layer) 
      --> Creates Collison Damage 
            --> 2 Nodes sending signals @ the same time 

    Switch(Data Link)
      --> Seperates collison Damage 
        --> Allow nodes to talk at the same time 

    Router(Network Layer) 
      --> Only foward ip packets
          --> Prevent collison and Broadcast domain

      (PORT 1,2 = TR)
            3,6 = RX 

    DTP(Dynamic Transfer Protocol)
    Dot1q
    IEEE 802.1q
    Trunk=Tagged ports 
    IEEE 802.1q frame
