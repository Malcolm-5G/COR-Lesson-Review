Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
  --> What it takes to kepp the business running =  entire organizatijon

Manangement Theory 
  1)Finicial 
  2) Operational 
  3) MArket Sales

BIA(Business Impact Analysis) 
  --> Identify Access/process
    --> Critical To Operations 


Disaster Recovery Plan 

Downtime 
  --> Percentage of time system offline

CIA Triade 
  Confidentality 
    --> Encryption 
  
  Intgrity
    --> No change/Alteration 

  Avaibillty 
    --> Access

High Availabilty 
  --> Operating withiut any interupptions 
    --> HAving bakc up systems to continue operation

Fault Tolerance 
  --> Maintain uptime in case of a failure 
    --> Single --> redundance, NICS 
  Maximum Tolerance Downtime (MTD)
    --> Amount of outage time allows w/o causing unacceptable harm
  System of 9's
    Availabilty                       Annual MTD 
    99.9999%                         00:00:32
    99.999%                          00:05:15
    99.99%                           00:52:34
    99.9%                            08:45:36
    99%                              87:36:00

Fault Tolerance
  --> Redundant Hardware
  --> RAID
  --> UPS
  --> High Availabity 
      --> Reduncancy doesn't away means available

Load Balance/ Fail Over
  --> Aggregate bandwidth, redunant paths 
    --> More important to Virtaul Machines 

Multipathing = MESH 

RTO
  --> Recovery Time Objective
    --> Time Operations
RPO
  --> Recovery Point Objective 
    --> Data loss with in Time

MTTR  --> Means Time TO Repair
    --> average time to repair
MTTF --> Mean Time To Fail
        --> Lifespan before failure 
            --> None Repairable 
MTBF --> Mean TIME BEFORE FAILURE
      --> AVerage time between two failures

      SITE
  HOT  -- Fully Equip
  COLD -- Barely to no Equip
  WARM -- Partical Equipment 
  Cloud

  Power Management 

  Link Aggergation 
    --> Stake Swittches
  STP Spanning Tree Protocol 
    --> Fixes broadcasting through prioity
  NIC Teaming 
    --> Combine NIC Cards into ONE

  Load Balancing 
    --> Distrubt traffic evenly through the network 
        "TRAFFIC COP"
  What are the rules to Load Balancing 
    1) Round Robin **
    2) AI/Applicaiton - Aware
    3) Percentage - Weighted Average**

  Clusters
    --> Two or more Servers 
  Active - Active 
    --> Both running together 
  Active - PAssive 
    --> One server works while the other waits on standby

Baseline 
  -->Point of Start/ Start Parmeter

Change Mangement 

Asset/ Asset Managment 

CDP  vs LLDP

CDP 
  --> Cisco Discovery Protocol 

LLDP
  --> Link - Layer Discovery Protocol

Quaility of Services (QoS)
  --> Application recivees high bandwaidth 

Bandwidth
  --> Amount of info that can be transmitted 

Latency 
  --> Time it take for transmit to reaach dstination


SNMP Simple Network Mangement Protocol
  --> Manage devices on the IP network
    -> Can Manage devices wisely
SNMP Manager
MIB -- Management Base = Database/ Table
    --> Recoerds of a Specific device
SNMP Trap 
    --> Alert to agent
