Class Review

In today's class, Mr. Davis covered the 7 basic fundamentals of a computer, which form the foundation of how computers work. These fundamentals are crucial to understanding the overall functioning and architecture of a computer.

We also discussed the 7 essential parts of a computer and how each contributes to its operation. Mr.Davis key focus was on the motherboard, which serves as the central hub that connects all the components. We examined the following key parts found on the motherboard:

CPU (Central Processing Unit) – The brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and processing data.
Storage – The component that holds data and software, including both temporary (RAM) and permanent (hard drives, SSDs) storage.
RAM (Random Access Memory) – A type of volatile memory that temporarily stores data and instructions that are actively being used by the CPU.
PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) – A high-speed interface used for connecting additional hardware components like graphics cards, network cards, and storage controllers to the motherboard.
Bus – The data pathways that allow communication between the different parts of the computer, enabling the CPU, memory, and other components to work together.
BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) – Firmware embedded on the motherboard that provides the necessary instructions for booting the computer and managing basic hardware operations.
Chipset – A set of integrated circuits that helps manage data flow between the CPU, memory, and other peripheral devices.
We went more in-depth into the topic of storage, discussing the differences between various storage technologies. Specifically, we looked at how internal storage differs from external storage in terms of speed, capacity, and the way data is accessed and managed. We also explored different storage types, such as HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) and SSDs (Solid-State Drives), highlighting their respective advantages and disadvantages.

Lastly, we covered the three main operating systems (OS) that are widely used:

Microsoft Windows – Known for its user-friendly interface and wide software compatibility. It is the most commonly used OS, especially in business and personal computing.
Apple macOS – Known for its sleek design, stability, and tight integration with Apple hardware. It is popular in creative industries and among users who prefer a more closed ecosystem.
Linux – An open-source OS known for its flexibility, customization options, and security. It’s widely used in servers, programming, and by tech enthusiasts.
