Routing Technologies 
    --> Layer 3 --> Network

Static 
  --> ROAD TRIP
        --> Out - Of - Bounds
            --> Manually configure Routing
Dynamic 
  --> Automatic Routes
        --> Hops/Speed to the best route = Latency 
                --> Pratices using alogrithms to automatically determine the best route path 

Rules 

MAC Address --> Tell who you are --> Physical 
                                                    ---> They work TOGETHER to make sure the message/data is delivered to the right network/host!!
IP Address --> Where you are --> Mobile/Can Change


Routing Table
    --> Show IP Route ---> What IPs each network has 

Subinterface
    --> Physical interface
            --> Configure options for each interface

Routing Metrics 
    --> Hop Counts 
          --> Bandwidth --> higher bandwidth= lower/cost
              --> Traffics --> Amount of traffic currently 
                  --> Delay/LAtency --> Amount of time it takes for a packet to travel 
                    --. MTU --> The maxium transmission unit the maxium size of signal 
                      --> Reliability --> The likehood that a given likn will fail or experince errors

Packet Frame
|SRC MAC|DEST MAC|SRC IP|DEST IP|

Routing Protocols
Distance Vectors 
  --> Neighbors 
   -->Rumors/Fake
     --> HOPs
       --> Protocols --> RIP,IGRP 

Link-State
  --> Real/Factual
    -->Talks to Everyone 
      --> Not a rumor,Latency 
        --> Protocol --> OSPF, ISIS

Extertior
  --> BGP
    --> Internet 

Hybrid 
  -->EIGRP
