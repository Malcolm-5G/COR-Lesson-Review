Day 3 @ COR

In today’s class, Dr. Adam Bricker discussed various learning strategies to enhance our understanding and retention of new material. He emphasized the importance of studying actively after encountering new information. One of the key strategies he recommended was reading a book for about 15 minutes, then taking a short break before testing yourself on what you’ve just read. This method helps to reinforce memory and improve comprehension.

Additionally, Mr. Bruce, the founder of COR, came to speak to the class and shared his incredible work with my fellow colleagues. He is deeply passionate about helping others, particularly women, by providing essential everyday necessities needed for survival. Mr. Bruce has dedicated over 20 years of service to this foundation, and his efforts have made a positive impact on the lives of countless young women across the country. His commitment to empowering others is truly inspiring.

Both Mr. Bruce and Dr. Bricker exemplify a level of service and dedication that I aspire to achieve. Their influence and work have deepened my gratitude for being part of this program, and I am even more excited about the opportunity to learn and grow alongside such passionate individuals.
