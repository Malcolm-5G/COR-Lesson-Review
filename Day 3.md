Day 3 @ COR

Today Dr. Adam Bricker went over different strategies of learning. Mr. Bricker is very adamant about how you should study after learning something new. Good example of that is reading a book for 15 minutes, take a break and quiz yourself about what you just read. Mr. Bruce the founder of COR came to talk and talked to my fellow colleagues. I love the passion that Mr. Bruce has about helping others (women specific) have the essential every day necessities to survive. His 20+ years of service to this foundation has improved numerous of young women’s throughout the country. Both Mr. Bruce and Mr. Bricker both shows a level of service that one a yearn to achieve. I’m truly thankful to be apart of this program even more.
