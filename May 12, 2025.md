Class Review

Wireless Key Words
Frequencies 
 Bandwidths 
  --> 2.4 ghz
  --> 5 ghz
  --> 6 ghz
802.11 Standards
802.3 --> Ethernet 
802.1q --> VLan Trunk 
802.1x --> NAC
802.11 --> WiFi
  --> 11b --> 2.4 ghz --> 11 mbps
  --> 11a --> 5 ghz   --> 54 mbps
  --> 11g --> 2.5 ghz --> 54 mbps
  --> 11n --> 2.4 ghz --> 600 mbps --> 4 x MIMO
  --> 11ac--> 5 ghz   --> 1 gbps   --> 8 x MU-MIMO
  --> 11ax--> 5/2.4ghz--> 1,201 mbps-> 8 x DL x UC MU MIMO

2.4ghz 
  --> Non - Overhopping Channels
      # 1,6,11
5 ghz 
  --> 25 Non- Hopping Channels

Gamma Rays --> Smallest wavelength
Radiowave  --> The largest wavelength 

EMI(Electromagnatic Interferance)
  Largest to Smallest 
    Radio/Microwave
    Inferred 
    Visible light 
    Ultraviolent 
    X-Rays 
    Gamma Rays


Radio 
  --> Transmit
        - Equipment turn electrical signals into electromagnetic waves
      
      Reciever
        - Equipment cathces waves and turns its back into electrical singals
Wave Characteristics 
  How does a wave becomes 1,0s?
    --> Modulation <--
          Change one or more 

Frequency Bands
  --> 2.4ghz  5ghz 6ghz
    --> FBand are divided into segments called "Channels"
  Channels
      --> Allow devices to simotaneously comminicated with in the same band
  Bands are divided into channels

  Wireless Basics 
    FHSS(Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum)
      -802.11 Version Based

    DSSS(Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum)
      -Tranmitter breaks data stream into small pieces "Chips" across multiple frequency in defined range 
        "Chips" spread over bandwidth @ the same time 
        Higher throughput than FHSS
          BUT.. Less Secure

    OFDM(Orthogonal Freq-Division Multiplexing)
      - Breaks data into small data streams to send info across long distance that may have enviromental obstacles
        -- used by 802.11 g/a/n and ac wireless network
          --Used by Wi-Fi 5 Wi-Fi 6 cellphones etc

    WiFi Signal Degragation
      --> Object things that distrub wifi signal 

    Attenuation
      --> loss of signal strength in networking cables or connection

  CSMA/CA(Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collion Avoidance 
  RTS/CTS Protocol 
    --> Wireless -- 802.3
      --> Ensures packets not hindered by other transmissions
