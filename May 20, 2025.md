Services 
Traditional 
  --> On - Premise (On Site)
  --> Iaas (Infastructre as a Sevice)
  --> Paas (Plataform as a Service)
  --> Saas (Software as a Service)

    POP(Point of Present)
  --> Edge Server
  --> Redundancy

NFV(Network Functual Virtualization)
  --> Seperate software from hardware 
  --> Decouples the Networ function from the program

  Instance
    --> Virtual Machine that run workload in a cloud
  VPC(Virtual Private Cloud)
    --> model provides isolated enviroment with in a public cloud
