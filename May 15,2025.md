802.11 Standard Security Default 

Encryption 
--> WEP 
--> WPA
--> WPA2
--> WPA3


Hash == Integrity   
  --> MD5,SHA == Algorithm Machines

Sysmmetric "Single Key" Key
  --> Single Key, Shared Key "One Key" 
    --> Can encrypt & Decrypt 
      --> RC5,*AES,DES,3DES == Algorithm Machines
      Bulk Encryotion == Signle Key 

Assymmetric Key 
   --> Public and Private Key 
     --> DH, RSA, ECC == Algorithm Machines

Public Assymetric Confidentialty 
      --> Send encrypts w/ reciver's pub key 
      <-- Rceciever dcrypts w/ recievers private key 

Public Key Assymetric Authenication
    --> Sender Encrypt message with sender's private key 
    <-- Reciever decrypts message with true parties public key 

Digtial Certificate  
    --> Provers the Identtity of a person, organization, and devices

Digital Siganture 
    --> Ensure message or file is Authenticate and hasn't been alterd

WEP --> Wired Equivelent Privacy 
  --> Never use 40 Bit 

WPA --> WIFI Protocaol Access
  --> TKIP --> Temporary KEy --> 

WPA2 
  --> 802. 11i Specification 
    --> AES Alogrithm 
      ---> 4 - way hanadshake 
WPA3 
  --> 128 bit >> Personal 
  --> 192 bit >> Enterprise 

Access Point 
  --> MAC Address 
  --> Wired/Wireless
  --> Controls who can connect

Rouge Access Point 
    --> Fradulent WiFi mimicking a legit network 
    == Unitentional ==

Evil Twin 
    --> Fradulent AP to lure users
    == Intentionally ==

Authentication 
  --> Verifying that a device is allowed to connect
    --> Can Authenticate by pre shared key or enterprise
DeAuthetication
  --> Proces of disconnecting a deviece from the Wifi network 

ROAM 
  --> Moving from one AP to anther AP within the same netwpork without losing connection

Dedicated Line
  --> Telecommunications path has continuously avaliabel communications channel

Virtual Circuit 
  --> WAN connection logically Appears

WAN == Wide Area Network 

  WAN Service Provider
    --> Telephone Network Provider         Service Provided
      Telehphone Network                Data
      Cable Company                     Voice
