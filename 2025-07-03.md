Lesson Review at COR


Our last day of the first week was anything but boring! On Friday, we were divided into teams to work together and figure out how to configure a spaceship panel to progress to the next level in a challenging game. We had to apply the development skills we had learned throughout the week, including discipline, collaboration, curiosity, teamwork, and more. This exercise was designed to test our ability to work effectively as a team while using the skills we’ve been developing.

After lunch, we played the game again to see if we could improve on our previous performance. This time, we were given the opportunity to collaborate with other teams to exchange ideas and strategies. This allowed us to learn from each other and incorporate new techniques into our approach, which helped us improve our results and beat our previous record.

I really enjoyed the energy and excitement in our class. Friday’s activity showed that everyone is committed to doing their best over the next seven months, and it created a strong sense of team spirit. The collaboration and shared enthusiasm were truly motivating.

Before the class ended, Mr. Bricker asked for the class’s input on how he could improve his training for future cohorts. This feedback session was a great opportunity for everyone to contribute ideas on how to enhance the overall learning experience moving forward.
