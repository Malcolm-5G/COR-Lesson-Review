Peer to Peer vs Client Server



Pros
Inexpensive
Easy to implement 
Individual devices can switch between client and sever
Every device can act as a client or server 
Easier to support 
Centralised Admin 
Each to Back - Up




	Cons
Difficult to Expand 
Difficult to Support
No central control 
No centralised storage 
Security Issues
Expensive server OS
Peer - to - Peer













Topologies


Physical Topology: This refers to the actual, physical layout of network devices (computers, routers, switches, etc.) and how they are connected with cables or wireless links. Examples include bus, star, ring, and mesh topologies.


Bus Topology – Imagine an old-school classroom with computers all connected to a single coaxial cable. If one part of the cable fails, the whole network can be affected.
			
Example: Early Ethernet networks in small offices.


Star Topology – Each device is connected to a central hub or switch, making it easy to manage and troubleshoot.



Example: Most modern home and office networks use Wi-Fi routers (acting as the central hub).




Ring Topology – Devices are connected in a circular manner, where data travels in one direction (or both, in a dual-ring setup).




Example: Older telephone networks and some fiber optic networks.









Mesh Topology – Every device connects to multiple other devices, ensuring redundancy and reliability.



Example: The internet itself, as well as military and large-scale communication networks.



Logical Topology: This describes how data flows within a network, regardless of the physical layout. Even if devices are arranged in a star shape physically, they might communicate as if they were connected in a ring or bus.

Bus Logical Topology – Even if devices are physically arranged in a star shape, they might behave as if they're on a shared single cable.


Example: Ethernet networks using a shared bandwidth like Wi-Fi hotspots.


Logical Ring Topology – Data moves in a structured way, even if the physical setup is different.


Example: IBM Token Ring networks used in older corporate settings



Hybrid Topology: This is a mix of two or more different topologies. For example, a company might use a star topology in one department and a mesh topology in another, combining them into a hybrid network.

SOHO Network

What is a SOHO Network?

>>>> Small Office/Home Office
		>>> Designed for small businesses and individuals operating within limited physical workspaces, such as homes or small offices. It provides connectivity and facilitates the sharing of resources among a small number of employees, typically ranging from 1 to 10.

 Troubleshoot Methodology

1. Identify the Problem
Gather information from users, logs, or monitoring tools.


Determine symptoms (slow network, device not connecting, etc.).


Identify recent changes that might have caused the issue.


2. Establish a Theory of Probable Cause
Based on the symptoms, consider potential reasons for the issue.


Use your knowledge of the system to come up with hypotheses.


Start with the simplest explanations first (e.g., "Is the cable unplugged?").


3. Test the Theory to Determine the Cause
Run tests to confirm or eliminate possible causes.


Use tools like ping, tracert, nslookup, or log analysis.


If the theory is wrong, go back to step 2 and try a new one.


4. Establish a Plan of Action and Identify Potential Effects
Once the root cause is found, create a fix while considering possible side effects.


Example: Restarting a router may solve the issue but could temporarily disconnect users.


5. Implement the Solution or Escalate
Apply the fix and verify if the issue is resolved.


If the issue is beyond your expertise, escalate to a higher-level technician.


6. Verify Full System Functionality and Implement Preventative Measures
Test the network or system to ensure the problem is completely resolved.


Implement steps to prevent the issue from happening again (e.g., update firmware, improve security, or educate users).


7. Document Findings, Actions, and Outcomes
Keep a record of the problem, how it was fixed, and lessons learned.


This helps with future troubleshooting and creates a knowledge base for others.
