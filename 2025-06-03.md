Review Time

 Today, Mr. Bricker went over several important learning skills that can significantly improve how we retain and understand new material. Before diving into the specific skills, he highlighted a few key factors that affect how we learn and remember what we’ve studied. One major point he emphasized was the importance of sleep. He explained that deep rest is essential for memory retention, as it helps our brain process and store information. This is something I personally struggle with, especially due to my busy and imbalanced schedule.

Mr. Bricker also introduced three forms of learning: build, redact, and grow. These forms help guide how we approach learning in a way that’s not just about gaining new knowledge, but also refining and expanding on what we already know.

One of the most valuable insights Mr. Bricker shared was the idea that you only truly remember what you study when it’s hard. This means that effective learning involves pushing yourself to engage with material that challenges you, rather than taking the easy route.

The two learning skills we focused on today were discipline and curiosity.

Discipline is crucial for effective learning. One key piece of advice Mr. Bricker shared was the importance of avoiding multitasking. He stressed the need to focus on one task or objective at a time. Additionally, he encouraged us to ask ourselves, "What are you distracted from?" Identifying our distractions is important because it helps us become aware of external influences that prevent us from focusing and allows us to minimize them while studying.

Curiosity was the second skill discussed. Curiosity sparks our interest in a particular subject, object, or topic. When we are curious, we naturally tend to question and explore new aspects of the things we are learning, which enhances our understanding and engagement with the material. Curiosity drives us to ask deeper questions and seek more knowledge.

Overall, today’s session was incredibly informative about how to cultivate discipline and curiosity in our studies. Learning how to stay focused and minimize distractions while maintaining a sense of curiosity is key to becoming a more effective learner.
